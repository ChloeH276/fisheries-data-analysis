# Data Analysis in Fisheries Science

There are 6 students doing their final-year project at the University of York on Data Analysis in Fisheries Science:

-   Chloe Hodson
-   Jacob Passfield
-   Maisie Beckett
-   Scott Connors
-   Tallulah Coyte
-   Felix Carter

They are supervised by [Gustav Delius](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/gustav-delius/) except for Felix who is supervised by [Jon Pitchford](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/jon-pitchford/).

We will interact as a group via this GitHub repository. In particular, we will use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gustavdelius/fisheries-data-analysis/issues) as our discussion forum where students can ask questions or share helpful information.
